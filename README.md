About:
Food N@ More is an app that helps to keep track of the user's calorie intake. 
You can signup for a free account and input the food you ate and it'll tally your total calories so far.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JQuery, mySQL, Heroku, VUE, Express, Handlebars, Sequelize, Passport, USDA DB.

Vue: There is alot that can be done through Vue but for this project it was just used as a source to introduce new technology. 
     There's a little bit of code that'll give the last time user logged in whenever someone hovers over the about section in the main page.
     
     
Future Development: Originally we intended to design it so that we'll take the portion amount aswell and then calculate the total based
      on that but we ran out of time to tackle this issue. We would also add more to the app where individual can pick up restaurants they
      are eating at and input the calories that their meal has and do crowd sourcing to get those data aswell. Also
      
      
USDA DB: For this project we ended up adabting USDA data into mySQL instead of making API calls.
